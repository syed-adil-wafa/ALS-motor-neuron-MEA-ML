## Multivariate electrophysiological phenotyping of human iPSC-derived spinal motor neurons in ALS using ensemble machine learning

### Summary
Many nervous system diseases, such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), exhibit disruptions in neuronal activity and altered neural network connectivity. We developed functional assays to model such diseases in a dish. Using multi-electrode array recordings, we monitored spontaneous extracellular field potentials of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived spinal motor neurons from patients with ALS and isogenic controls. ALS is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by loss of motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord. To determine whether electrophysiological patterns exist in this disease model, we implemented an ensemble machine learning algorithm (Breiman's random forest algorithm) and quantified the importance of 33 electrophysiological parameters in distinguishing diseased and control neurons. We show that increased spiking, increased bursting and shorter inter-burst intervals underlie hyper-excitability in iPSC-derived motor neurons with a *SOD1* mutation, which corresponds with clinical features of hyper-excitability in ALS patients. Our results demonstrate that a multivariate phenotyping platform can be used to gauge excitability in diseased neuronal networks and can be used as an unbiased approach for electrophysiological screening of iPSC-derived neurons.
